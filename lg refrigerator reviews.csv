Hamza,"Cypress, TX","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2023","I am writing to express my utter dismay and outrage as an LG customer. Can you believe that I actually bought an LG refrigerator, only for it to become a complete disaster?

Samuel,"Hanmer, Other","Reviewed Aug. 4, 2023","If I read the reviews on this page, I may have a different opinion today but I didn’t. I bought a house in 2022 with a French door refrigerator of 2020. The fridge broke down six weeks ago. I invited a local shop to repair, they informed me that the compressor was bad and that no technician was available in the area to fix a new one even if I decided to get a new compressor, as LG recently changed their technology. A day after, LG contacted me and asked me to purchase another one and send the bill of lading along with the sticker of the old fridge. They would pay me $743 and also take away the old fridge. It took me a while to decide but I finally agreed to that proposal.",1

After much effort supplying the pictures & information requested, I was told that was considered wear & tear. I could have been informed of that WITHOUT any of my efforts. Less than a month later, I noticed when closing the refrigerator door the freezer door opens & closes. I live alone, my fridge is less than a year old & in spotless condition. Having already been made aware of non-covered parts, I did not waste my time calling. THIS IS MY FIRST & LAST LG REFRIGERATOR. It is falling apart before my eyes!!!",2

Helen,"Delray Beach, FL","Reviewed June 7, 2023","I bought an LG refrigerator top freezer. I had bought this refrigerator twice before and this was my third time. Well - they did away with a lot of the features that I had in my last 2 purchases like no freezer light and no deli bin. Really dumb move. I returned the refrigerator and bought a Frigidaire. I love it. I had also bought the ice maker for the LG refrigerator direct from the LG website. Well, I now wanted to return the ice maker as I no longer have the refrigerator. Hours on the phone - can't get anyone who speaks an English that I can understand. Their policy is a 2 wk window to return. This was 2 1/2 weeks that I had the ice maker.

I am super mad that LOWE'S obviously knows they are selling bad appliances because they stopped taking returns in March 2023. You have to have it back in store in 48 hours or NO REFUND! It was a weekend after I purchased it and I did not contact them until the following Tuesday to discuss returning the broken fridge. THEY HAVE to know they are selling bad products. Why else would they say NO to a refund of a brand new appliance? LG has sent repair man out 2x. New compressor didn't fix it so he is now going to replace the motherboard and condenser because I requested a buyout from LG and they won't give me my money back until there have been two repairs on the same part.",1

LG told me they had No other authorized facilities in my area so they issued me a Refund check that was a fourth of what I paid for the refrigerator.

Mary,"Sneads Ferry, NC","Reviewed May 16, 2023","Bought a very expensive LG refrigerator 18 mos. Ago. Three weeks ago, it just stopped making ice. Craft ice and ice machine in the door. After reviewing the owners manual and watching numerous lg videos on Youtube we were unable to fix the issue. I called lg customer service and was told the refrigerator stopped making ice because it needed a software update. There is nothing in the manual stating this might be the issue, nor did I receive any notification from lg that this was a mandatory update to keep the refrigerator running properly. One week later, craft ice is working but ice machine in door is not working. Again, nothing in the manual or lg website for troubleshooting this issue.",1
Michael,"Johnson City, TN","Reviewed May 1, 2023","My story begins Feb 8th with the purchase of 3 identical refrigerators with top freezer offer, a factory installed filtered water dispenser and option ice maker. Our company has many apartments for rent in the downtown area and these refrigerators were selected base on 33” wide dimensions and convenience features. Refrigerators arrived on or about Feb 15th 2023 but the optional ice makers were backed ordered.. Ice makers arrive 1st April and installed as accordance to LG instructions. Instructions state it sometimes takes 24 to 48 hours to make ice. After 72 hours no ice. Go back to retail we purchased from to inform and they sent technicians to investigate. They were unable to resolve the issue. Next step LG sends their authorized technician and his conclusion was the the plug and play wire harness was defective and that no current was feeding the servo that supplied water to the ice maker.

Sean,"Winterset, IA","Reviewed April 18, 2023","I purchased an LG refrigerator about 7 years ago, one of the reasons besides the features was that it had a 10 year warranty on the compressor. So this past weekend, opened the refrigerator and it was warm, freezer was thawing out. I spent several hours on hold trying to get a hold of someone, and then my wife got a hold of someone the following day after being on hold for hours. They could barely speak English, and there was no one in the area that could work on it, and was told it would be cheaper for us to buy a new one than to pay someone to come from hours away to work on it. I talked to some local repair facilities and no one would do it because they said LG does not pay their warranty claims. I have medication that has to be refrigerated, so had to buy a new refrigerator. Not happy and my new refrigerator is not an LG.",1

This sounded absurd to me, so I offered to locate, and pay a repair provider.

The ice CANNOT be used in your drinks. The awful taste gets in your drinks. I have never had this experience with other refrigerators before. Samsung and Frigidaire is good. I've changed the filter on the LG fridge to see if that was the problem, and it still had the same awful taste. LG refuses to take back their fridge saying it's my water line that's the problem. NO IT'S NOT! Again, I didn't have this problem with Samsung or Frigidaire. It's LG's awful product! Don't by LG refrigerators customers. It's possible that this water can do something to your health.

Jonathan,"Jacksonville, FL","Reviewed Dec. 8, 2022","After only 9 months of use we cut our losses and got rid of our new LG refrigerator (model # LMWC23626S). The reasons are twofold: poor product performance and even worse aftermarket service. Due to pandemic supply issues the appliance was ordered in November 2020 and delivered late January 2021. This was a proactive approach for a home we were building. The refrigerator was securely stored in its shipping box till its installation in March 2022 (home construction was delayed due to the pandemic). Within a month the fridge stopped working, registering a “FF” (freezer fan) error code. Rebooting the appliance only led to a repeat of the same error code.",1

LG refused to cover my food losses, saying the 5 days my refrigerator was down shouldn't have resulted in lost food. On November 27, 2022 both freezer and and refrigerator have failed again, and the soonest the repair service call could be scheduled was for tomorrow November 30th.

They give you the run around and do nothing but run you in circles hoping you will get frustrated and go away. Our brand new refrigerator came with a factory defect and trying to get LG to repair or replace it has been a frustrating and time consuming effort. Their solution - give me a refund, take my refrigerator and the be without a refrigerator for 3-6 weeks while we wait for another refrigerator to be delivered. REALLY? Be without a refrigerator for weeks is their solution? Bottom line - they got our money and they do not care whether we have a product that is 100% functional.

Jarred,"Denver, CO","Reviewed July 21, 2022",Bought this fridge due to consumer reports highest rating. I really wish I did some research beyond that! LG has a long history of Compressors going out. So much so that they extend their warranty to 5 years. Fine. Mine goes out in 3 years. Fine. Here’s the kicker. The worst customer service ever. Additionally they only have one company to do the repairs in the entire Denver Metro Area. Fine. Company has now completely blown us off for two days. No shows for their service. I read that company’s reviews. I’m not the only one. It’s a thing with them to just not show up. Long story short. Please! Stay clear of LG Refrigerators. I really wish I had.,1

But when I finally spoke with them they said it sounds like a compressor and it is warranted. I contacted the names of the service providers they recommended. All these companies said they would not perform LG warranty work because of the lack of timely payment. I again called LG customer service and requested an in house technician and was told none were available and to go back to their recommended service providers with a APN or approval number. I tried this but numerous service providers said no way on LG warranty work. So I seem to have no freezer and no way to have warranted work performed.

Now, our refrigerator has failed with a known fault and is not yet being fixed. We had a service appointment today which they cancelled. Rescheduled for 3 weeks later. That will be a month with no refrigerator. We bought what we thought was a high end refrigerator and it has worked great for a short time, but then just quit cooling. LG has been less than exemplary on fixing it. This is a very bad move, company wise. I now have a totally negative impression of LG and any of their products. I will NEVER buy another LG product. I just don't trust them anymore. We have to wait a full month without a refrigerator to find out if our refrigerator will even be fixed. Last LG item of any kind I will ever buy.",1

Christine,"South Pasadena, CA","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2021",I agree with the majority of the people regarding LG fridge. I purchased an expensive counter depth fridge 5 years and 7 months ago and it completely broke down. Not the compressor but a leakage within the wall of the fridge so it cannot be repaired. I paid $125 to the LG technician to come and inspect to tell me that it cannot be repaired and that I should get a new fridge. The technician also let me know that the leakage was a manufacturing issue not wear and tear. I am aware of the LG settlement and was shy of 7 months to claim anything. LG refuses to do anything about it. So basically all their products are useless. I will never purchase another LG product and will make sure that everyone I know do the same.

Since I am now about 7 months past that 5 years warranty, LG will cover the parts to repair, but not the labor.

It broke down 2 additional times to-date. During this time, my refrigerator (model LMX530776S) and approx. 50 other models, were identified as DEFECTIVE and covered by a Class Action Suit. At this point, I requested that LG replace my refrigerator. As stated above, the Customer Service Dept. became totally curt and unhelpful. They lied to me about the status of my claim and repeatedly declined to connect me to a manager. Once I received an email from the Problem Solution Dept., that I was later informed didn’t exist! LG dragged this out until my warranty expired and never fixed my fridge. I will NEVER Buy Another LG Product Again.",1

I bought all new kitchen appliances five years ago (all LG) and the most expensive was the french door refrigerator. It is supposed to have a ""state of the art"" linear compressor. Well, please research and you will see many people in the same position as myself. After two years, the refrigerator compressor failed. It was like pulling teeth to have LG get a technician out to my home even though it is under warranty. Low and behold, after numerous calls I was able to get a technician to my home to say I need a new compressor. Parts needed to be ordered - another delay which took about three weeks. ",1

Tom,"Rio Rancho, NM","Reviewed Nov. 3, 2020",Purchased top of the line LG fridge in May2020. Ice maker stopped working early August. Took 2 weeks for repairman to arrive. Said would need to replace ice maker. Part on back order. It came last week October. Replaced by repairman. Didn’t work. Repairman came back. Said needed data study and left unit in freezer for 4 days. Now they say need to replace circuit card. On order. Says if that doesn’t fix it will probably need to replace compressor. I called customer service and was told they will probably never replace the fridge. I am totally sick of this. LG is a terrible company.,1
Debra,"Asheville, NC","Reviewed Nov. 1, 2020",Since purchasing this refrigerator just a few years ago and thinking it would be great only a few months afterwards came the first compressor failure. Having to call customer service somewhere Across the Universe and get in touch with anyone who is willing to come out and fix it was a chore. Apparently most repair places do not want to work with LG because of these issues and their difficulty in compliance. And when they came out and checked it then the compressor took weeks to get there. Each time. This happened at least three more times and I think four because one time they claimed it was something else but three times it has been a compressor failure. So much so that the technician who came recently to the house actually had a compressor on his truck because he said nine times out of 10 the refrigerator has a compressor failure again and again so they are carrying them on their trucks. ,1
Elizbeth,"Vicksburg, MS","Reviewed Nov. 1, 2020",Updated on 11/12/2020: I posted a review a month ago regarding compressor failure under warranty. I originally contacted LG direct and they gave me an authorized service center. They charged $160.50 for a 10 minute service call and I am still waiting on a part month later and the labor will cost an additional $300. LG responded to my review and after several PMs they said to call them and they would pay for the labor. So I called and that is not going to happen. So I end up paying $460.50 for a known defective product!!!!,5

Ann,"Yakima, WA","Reviewed July 13, 2020","I purchased this fridge 2 years ago; it had good reviews and I was assured by the 10 yr compressor warranty. Turns out that you are just buying an ongoing problem! How can LG sell a known defective product? The refrigerator we replaced worked well for 27 years. Our warranty was voided because we tried to have it fixed first by a non-accredited LG tech, but it is the compressor that went out and LG has abandoned us in a technicality. And if we had it repaired, in all likelihood it would go out again in 2 years. I love the design and look, but not worth the $3k problem. After reading multiple reviews, seems that LG knowingly continues to put out a defective product. Shame on you LG!",1

Almost every person who bought one of these, has the problem that it stops cooling after 2 years. I have read this over and over and over and over. If you replace the compressor-it breaks again in 2 years. It is ridiculous that I read reviews saying this is a great product when a class action lawsuit was opened up over this defect? Why can’t LG in S Korea manufacture a replacement compressor that isnt defective so everyone with this product can just put the new compressor in and everything is good? Instead 10’s of 1000’s of these are being left at city dumps.

We could not get any response when calling LG so just decided to get a tech to look at it. Took him a week to get back to us because of the holidays. He told us the sealed freon system was broken and the compressor was toast and he could not do the repair. He charged us for the visit and left. He said it would cost a lot of money to fix - So we tried to contact another service company to fix it. ,1

The front seal, intended to prevent moisture intrusion from the exterior of the unit, instead prevents moisture introduced by the ice chute from escaping the chamber.",1

No one works on them in my area. When you call they say, ""We don't work on LG refrigerators!"" Then why have the warranty. It's junk. I paid over $2 grand for a piece of junk. I called them. They give you numbers to service places. Then I call. They then tell me do work on them. I have told Lowe's and they don't care. So I will. Never buy LG again.",1

The temperature control doesn't seem to be as good as it was on the other one. I have a separate temperature gauge and many times, it isn’t as cold as it should be. I even had somebody come out to the house and it hasn’t made a difference. The fridge is fine as far as where the shelves are, but I am not happy.",1
Donnie,"Hartwell, GA","Reviewed Sept. 24, 2019","LG fridge bought in Aug. 2017. Worked good for almost 2 years, and then the madness started in July 2019. As of today the compressor has been changed, then a 2nd trip to fix a leak supposedly, 2 weeks after that the ice maker quits working. Technician is now saying it is the flanges on the freezer doors not sealing properly. Technician orders parts and I get a call today from the parts department saying that parts are on backorder and they have no clue how long it may be. I will never buy an LG appliance again. $2000.00 just does not buy you what it used to. If LG would just own up and say they are selling a defective product and make it right, it might not be so bad. But all they keep doing is kicking the can down the road. I am officially, over it. If something is not done soon, I am to the point of trying to see if I can do anything legally. There has to be a lemon law or something like that on products like this.",1

Joseph,"Pasadena, CA","Reviewed Sept. 24, 2019","I'd owned my firs LG refrigerator since August and it was horrible. It was delivered broken and in the beginning, LG wanted to send technicians out to repair the refrigerator instead of just sending me a replacement. Because I had to keep escalating the situation, the replacement was determined. It took two months for the replacement to arrive. In that aspect, I was not pleased at all. I had to go back the retailer and they had to give me a loaner refrigerator. In terms of the product, I’m a big fan. I am pleased with the replacement as so far, it's been working fine and hasn’t given me any problems. I like the overall layout of the refrigerator, but I find the icemaker and the water dispenser very noisy. As soon as I put a cup to it and I wanna get some ice cubes, it starts to crank up the motor and it’s loud.",2
Candyce,"Fort Collins, CO","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2019","When we bought this LG French door fridge, I loved it. Seriously, loved it. The capacity, the drawers, everything was perfect. Until it wasn't. 3 years after purchase (almost exactly 3 years, and after the warranty had expired), it started making a really loud noise. Then it stopped working and displayed a fault error code that the fan was not functioning. After a LOT of effort to find an LG repair service (not a single firm in Northern Colorado services LG), a support tech suggested that we try defrosting the fridge. So we removed all our food, unplugged it, and let it thaw out. It took 48 hours to fully defrost. Throughout that time, we heard big blocks of ice breaking free between the back wall and the internal liner. Then we wiped it down, plugged it in, and it worked properly with no noise.",4

Chas,"Cincinnati, OH","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2019","We were limited by the space we had available to put the refrigerator in height as well as depth and width. Issue of getting in the doors of the house also. We had to take handles off refrigerator and freezer doors to get the unit in the house. Don't really like that we now have a water filter on the ice and water line that needs to be replaced ever 6 months. The excess ice needs to be taken off the door and dumped into the ice bin in the freezer. Freezer is on the bottom and when drawer is pulled out it limits movement into the kitchen area from family room. The housing for the water filter is not all that substantial could have been designed a little better. Still, we like the led lighting the ice and water dispensers and individual compartments for fruits and vegetables. The door display reminds you of how long the doors are open.",3

It should be more futuristic like have a smart display like some other refrigerator. But this refrigerator does an excellent job of keeping all our groceries cool. It was a nice refrigerator and it fits our budget at the time. I still would have like to go with a more premium model. But for now this is one of the best refrigerator. If I could change something about this refrigerator it would be to have an even bigger freezer than what we have now, right now it's fine but it always good to have more space or if the ice machine could produce ice faster.",4

All lg products that I have owned have all lasted as long as they were guaranteed to last while keeping their word on the productivity of these products and much much more. I loved the double doors, large compartments, the removable bins and freezer shelves. The ice compartment size was amazing and never ran out of ice and had to wait on more to be made. I also enjoyed the filtration system as it did not need to be changed as often as a lot of other refrigerators I have seen. I would improve some of the ways the shelves were built into the inside to where they are all adjustable, making it easier to store larger items and more items altogether.",5
Edwin,"Killeen, TX","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2019",I chose this one because of specs and it was also within my price range.

A double at the top and a single at the bottom. It has LED display and is a beautiful color. There is nothing that I dislike about the refrigerator. But an improvement that could be made is an LED TV display. For like when you're lounging in the kitchen you'll have something to watch from time to time.,5
Christi,"Huntsville, AL","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2019",We liked the features and with the product on sale it was easily affordable for us since we had a limited budget. I also wanted the ice maker it had since the bin was easy to clean. It did meet my initial expectations. The internal lights were different so the bulbs didn't blow easy. It had a great ice maker along with an ice and water dispenser. It also had plenty of room. But the water filter system was at the bottom front. It was difficult to open and made changing the filter difficult. I would have preferred the filter to be in a more accessible place so I didn't have to get down on the floor.

Eri,"Columbia, SC","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2019",I chose the LG refrigerator because I had done a lot of research and it was the best one of all. It is large and can hold most of our groceries with no issues. All I wanted it to do was hold groceries and it has more than met that expectation. It has a door that separates and lets you have more storage for more items. The freezer is huge and has a lot of room. I am able to find things I need quickly and easily. It is the best refrigerator I have ever had. It's nice and I am very happy with it. I cannot think of much I would want to improve. Maybe making the ice maker faster is something as it can be very slow and I am impatient. Sometimes it doesn't stay as cold as I would like but it is very easy to fix.,5

Indeed, most of the features are satisfactory and I can think of few, if any, that aren't. Though the bottom shelves are somewhat small for my liking.

Sometimes my refrigerator doesn't get as cold as I'd like it to if I have too much food in it. It is a bigger refrigerator so I can pack it full, but the fuller it is the less cold it gets, and I often have to throw out food that requires a certain temperature of coolness so I have to be cautious of how much food I buy that requires refrigeration.",5

To me it should have at least came with a ice maker. Even though a bit pricey, I am overall satisfied with my purchase. My last refrigerator was a complete joy.

I like to be able to have my fridge produce ice rather than going to buy ice or having to make it with a tray. The features that I dislike about the refrigerator is that after a while, the freezer component becomes very noisy when you open it.

When I make mixed drinks and daiquiris it's easier to not have to crush the ice myself for so long. The temperature was not always the easiest to control though. Sometimes the refrigerator got too cold and my vegetables got frost on them. When I turn it down too low the vegetables all spoiled too quickly.,3

Melinda,"Waterloo, ON","Reviewed Sept. 20, 2019","Wanted to share my experience so that others know before purchasing. Purchased my fridge in 2015 and within the first two weeks I had issues (French door model). Two technicians were unable to properly align the doors and the doors remain unfixed at this time. As a result of this defect that could not be repaired under LG manufacturer’s warranty, this caused the fridge to run non-stop and compressor to fail. The third technician who attended our residence this past March agreed that the doors were uneven that there was condensation and leakage which likely caused the compressor to fail but refused to investigate the door issue further.

Vence,"Gainesville, GA","Reviewed Sept. 20, 2019","Refrigerator Envy: that’s what our friends said when they saw our new LG refrigerator. NO MORE! Problems began the first year, and five years and many repairs later – most we paid for; LG covered a few – the problems have simply worsened. We’ve lost hundreds of dollars in food waste, spent over $800 in “repairs”, and endured countless inconveniences as a result of food freezing in the refrigerator. We now keep fruits and vegetables in our sixteen year-old garage Whirlpool. The design flaw, we’ve been informed, is known by LG and has been addressed in their newer models.",1

This fridge has been repaired several times and It would work for a week or a few days then go out again. I have lost hundreds of dollars in food and they refuse to reimburse me for the fridge.

Online there were very electorate reviews from multiple retailers and review websites about how this refrigerator, in general, was the best one that many of the spoken consumers had every previously owned. I like the water filter, cooling levels, storage space, stainless steal, and ice machine. Additionally, it has a wide breadth, lots of shelves, easy to clean interior and exterior, and good lighting inside the machine. Sound levels, height, and some leakage at the bottom occasionally. Otherwise, there is nothing else I notably dislike.

It was overall a really nice refrigerator. I love it. I love it. I love it. I wouldn't trade it for nothing in this world. But the drawer could have been easier to maneuver.

The freezer section wasn't unnecessarily large and was all the space I really ever required. The fridge could have been larger though, but not for its price. The size of the fridge could've been larger with less unnecessary pullout shelves and more standard shelves. The door shelves were decent though. The production the the aforementioned ice was also somewhat long as well. The price of the refrigerator is what caught my attention. Then again, the fridge was on sale and wasn't at its standard market value, thus this opinion could be skewed or biased.",4

I also picked it because it was spacious and affordable. The LG refrigerator that I previously owned was spacious. It was also nice stainless steel design. It had a good ice maker that also gave you good cold water. I didn't like the fact that this refrigerator didn't last as long as I thought it would. It broke and would no longer keep my food cold. It was disappointing that my nice fridge broke and I had to purchase a new one.,2

Superior electronics in the door facing touch panel, the ice also would chip really finely which I adore. Also for the price point you can't beat the cu ft available, as well as the beautiful options for finish. Imported from overseas which is good with me but other American buyers may prefer a US brand like Whirlpool Corp, Maytag, Kenmore, Amana, Frigidaire, or a European brand such as Electrolux or Bosch.",4

The pricing is the first major obstacle to ownership. The size of the refrigerator is another thought to consider for apartment dwellers. It is a large refrigerator but not overly cumbersome in design so it equals out.",4

But the size is kind of inconvenient for the fridge space in my house. It had to be set out a little farther than expected. The bulkiness wouldn't fit in the area. It's a overall great product.

The last one is just so old and is about to finally break on us but this one isn't and we will have it for at least 6 years. The LG brand is the best refrigerator. I also like Samsung but LG is more popular and has the better reviews and the most likes so I see why people recommend it and I'm glad I got it for the family.

I have been satisfied with the look, functioning and features of my LG refrigerator. I like the inside of the refrigerator as much as the outside.

It had enough of the features I wanted at a price point I found attractive. I liked many features of my LG refrigerator. The first thing I liked about it was the color. It was my first stainless steel refrigerator. I also liked that it had side-by-side doors and the fridge was on top. It was cool at the time. I did not like that it needed a special water filter that was extremely expensive. I also grew to dislike the quality of stainless steel it was made from. It was too prone to smudging and the steel itself was too bright. I prefer a brushed or gunmetal finish to my stainless steel.,3

The one thing that I would for sure change is the door alarm timing.

We love the fridge, it holds so much stuff and blows pretty cold! We have plenty of storage for produce and frozen. If I would update anything it would be the size of the fridge. We love big spacious fridges. Again, you get what you pay for.",5
Ryan,"Mount Laurel, NJ","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2019",It was a good deal. The other brands were white but I wanted the very trendy brushed aluminum look. It was also at a store where I could get 5% cash back on my purchase so that was very nice too. I really like how cold it gets. It has a little drawer for my veggies which is also a good thing to have. I enjoy using my fridge because it is well made and is a great color. Would like it to have Bluetooth or wifi so I could connect to it. A screen would also be very cool so I could display family pictures and videos for my guests to see how cool my family is.,3
Jessica,"High Springs, FL","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2019","The features I liked about the LG refrigerator was my double side by side doors and the ice maker and water dispenser were the best part of it all. I would get it again if I needed another one anytime soon. The Only thing I didn't like was I think there could have been more shelves and storage room inside it. Overall it has been a really good refrigerator though, so I really can't complain about it too much. I never really had any issues. The reason I purchased the LG refrigerator when I did Is due to a sale they had going on at the time and I liked the style of the fridge. I chose this brand over other brands because I have purchased LG in the past and never had any issues with them at all.",5
Jessica,"Salt Lake City, UT","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2019",The most awesome refrigerator ever. I like the side by design. The look is very clean and attractive. It is great to have ice and not need to fill an ice tray. The slim style holds a lot of food like to get water from the door. This makes me thing to drink more water every time I pass by. The last several refrigerators ended with a wet mess on the food or frozen drinks. This fridge has done none of that. I like the organization of the food. There is ample room for all the items include milk in the door. We purchased the fridge because of the inner volume.,5
Chris,"Arkadelphia, AR","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2019","I was on the market for a new fridge but I didn't do so with a specific brand in mind. The LG I have now just so happened to be what I preferred when wholly considered, monetarily included. Along with a lot of others I'm sure, my favorite part was of course the ice/water section built into the door. It made life that much more convenient, which is something we as a species crave seemingly primarily, convenience. The side by side design was weird to me at first, I mean compared to the traditional top and bottom design which has the ""homey"" feeling of childhood, that felt more like staying the night at a buddies. But over time I've grown to love it overall.",5
Fred,"Harrisburg, PA","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2019",LG is a brand I really trust that is on the cutting edge of innovation and I am proud to have in my manor. It looks beautiful in the kitchen with the other stainless steel appliances. The LG refrigerator is stainless steel which makes it very attractive and resistant to fingerprints and smudges somewhat. The cubic foot footage is excellent and it has an ice maker and water dispenser as well as ample storage space and drawers. It's just a beautiful refrigerator. I considered several brands but LG was definitely one of the most stylish looking and was fully loaded with features and innovation at a price which was very reasonable considering the others.,5
Jessica,"Burton, MI","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2019","The LG refrigerator is the one that we had chosen, mainly because the store clerk recommended it over the other ones. Also it has not only met my expectations but it has exceeded them by far. My favorite feature is the shelving that is available. I have enough room for all of my groceries right after a big shopping trip for the week. It is very convenient. Also it is very easy to clean so it stays looking brand new at all times. But I think that the refrigerator could improve by having a bit more space between the shelves so that taller items might fit inside it a little bit better. I also think it would be nice for the freezer to be on the bottoms rather than it be side by side.",5
Paula,"Lancaster, OH","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2019","LED lighting, touchable black stainless steel, the layout of the shelving and 10 year limited warranty.

It was also pretty decent size. Overall I was very satisfied with all of this for the most part and since our old fridge was very small it made life a bit easier. I would improve a tad more space though, and more shelving available for use or drawers. I feel I would have liked it even more if there had been more space or Storage available for the items needing to be in the fridge since we do buy large amounts of groceries at a time. We have a bigger family so we have to get large amounts when we go grocery shopping and our old fridge would just never cut it per se.",4
Tonya,"Hazel Green, AL","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2019",I liked that it had an ice maker and a water dispenser and a rant big freezer with it in the bottom. Love the double doors that it has on it. I love my refrigerator so much. There wasn't much room in the doors of the refrigerator and the water dispenser did not get the water that cold. Also it took up a lot of room in the kitchen. I chose an LG refrigerator because of its name. It's known for laying a long time and being very good for the price. It's been almost exactly like I thought it would be.,4
Michael,"Universal City, TX","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2019",I like the overall size of it for the space I need and large freezer door on the bottom pullout as big as I need. I cook a lot so it's what I needed to fulfill my stuff. Actually the only thing I do not like on my whole fridge is the fridge does not come equipped with a water dispenser on it because I drink a lot of water and it would come in handy. It was between this model and a Kenmore and this was just a little larger for my taste and fits all my needs for everything I use it for since I cook a lot.,5

Kayla,"Saint Peters, MO","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2019","Many factors weighed in choosing which one to get purchased it because it was cheap and a good size. It can fit a lot for a small refrigerator, we have a tiny kitchen and that one fit. It keeps the food in the fridge nice and cold. I hate room temperature water and if I put water in, then it's cold almost immediately. It is a nice texture and overall a good fridge. Sometimes it can get too cold though. Things almost get frozen, which can be nice but also nasty and leave residue. It also broke so we had to buy a new one.",5
Jesus,"El Paso, TX","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2019","Lg is a very reliable brand that I trust with the manufacturing of electronic goods or machines. Their products have always exceeded my expectations. Lg is my preferred brand to go to right next to Whirlpool and Sony. It was one of the first models that could be linked to the water for ice or water distillation, modern design (at the time) and we got it for a deal. It generally did what it was supposed to do without any issues as far as chilling food items. It was really bulky though, wasn't enough interior space compared to the general size of the machine, the ice/ water distiller would clog or get dirty easily since it was connected to a hard water line. It was difficult to get into my small apartment. We needed to remove the doors, put it in place then reinstall the doors.",4
David,"Blythewood, SC","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2019",I initially didn't buy an LG. I won my first one at a Christmas party raffle. I took it home that night and enjoyed it for about four years and I had to sell it because of the size of my household was expanding. But we really don't have any negative effects with this brand. The refrigerator was a gem to own. Never had any problems with it not doing its job. Would buy another one without any hesitation. Always keep my food at a constant temperature. And keep my vegetables in the crisper crisp a little longer. The only problem I ever had was that it wasn't right for me in the realm of space. I would like to see a little bit more space in the freezer compartment. And towards the end of my ownership of the product it was making a little more noise from the compressor than usual.,5

I have kids so that is a big concern with me since I don't want people coming over to my house and seeing a dirty fridge people would think I'm a slob who doesn't clean my own house.

I called LG and they told me that they would have to send their own technician. That took almost two months and finally, the LG technician came to my house and changed a part.",1

Our refrigerator stopped cooling all together. After trying to do the simply things LG suggests, we had to call for service. Called on Thursday the 12th and they scheduled an appointment for Monday the 16th 1-5pm. I called the service company on Friday to confirm and they said there was nothing scheduled. Called LG and they set us up with another service provider; however, the earliest they could be out was Tuesday the 24th. Spent 55 mins on the phone with LG and they said they can't do anything else and the line to the service scheduling department is down. When they work they are great. When they break while still under warranty it's not worth it. Buy a different company's product. Thanks.",1

I have been happy with the design of the stainless steel unit and how it blends in to my kitchen with other stainless steel appliances. I enjoyed the design of the refrigerator freezer and its many compliments. The deli drawer perfect for small items like yogurt containers and cheese and deli. Had to rearrange the shelving to allow for taller items like milk, juice, ice tea etc. though. I would also improve the freezer compartments with additional shelving.",5

Simple things like the space and the defrost feature make the fridge helpful and low maintenance. It's easy to clean as well. Mostly, it was an affordable option for our current situation and we were able to purchase the warranty as well. But I don't like how short the shelves are and the fact that the butter falls out when I open the door. The shelves aren't. The shelves also have limitations as to how deep they are and how far they go back. This makes it hard to shop for foods that come in different packaging all enough to accommodate the drinks.",3

It felt like a luxury purchase and I wanted to upgrade from my Maytag side by side model that I had owned for 8 years. But the refrigerator really should have and needs more shelf depth. The drawers are a little smaller than I would like. The fridge is a little expensive. The freezer space smaller than I would like. Fingerprints hard to wipe off of the surface.,4

LG has met my expectations and I would recommend the fridge to others. I never had to have any repairs or service done on the fridge. The LG refrigerator had a lot of space for the food I needed to keep for a large family and lasted a long time. It also had a nice ice maker and was energy efficient. I only bought a new LG fridge because I was remodeling my kitchen and the fridge no longer matched with the updates. It was reliable and held up to the brand's claims. Maybe one thing that the LG company could improve on is warranty length on the product.,5

Sometimes I'm half sleep and it helps because I just stand in front of it and hold my glass under and push one button and there goes my water and or ice.

It's sleek and has plenty of room despite being smaller than the standard fridge. I like the bottom freezer, it has a drawer so it really maximizes the space in the freezer. If I had to change anything it would be on the outside.

It is black and has several bins & door compartments. I wish it had been cheaper and I wish the ice maker produced more ice and didn't stop working off and on. It's hard to crouch down to the very bottom of the freezer to find things.

There was nothing that I disliked about the appliance.",5

The sales person highly recommended it and I quickly found out why. I like the ice maker. It kept temperature well, and had an amazing seal. The inside door shelf designs were amazing. The air circulation inside the refrigerator was optimal, and the freezer froze things solid in more than adequate time. The color options were limited in my area, so I opted for the white one. When my kids got the fridge dirty, some of the paint came off upon washing it.",5

Likewise, it was difficult to share, like in a roommate situation. But liked the way it was designed with a gun metal-like sheen to it. It was extremely deep and didn't look like it would be hard for a short person to make use of the shelves.",2

Would also like it if the unit was quieter than it is. I did not realize that the unit is relatively close to my bedroom entrance and can hear it easily.

LG sent me a check for 150.00 which helped with the loss but did not replace everything that was lost from the compressor failure.

Because my mother in law is 88 years old and the estimated cost of repair was nearly the cost of a new refrigerator we chose to purchase her a new refrigerator rather than wait for it to be repaired. Sears says their warranty is only one year but the Sears rep said that the manufacturer provides a longer warranty on the compressor but labor would not be included.

Dylan,"Macon, GA","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2019","The refrigerator had a whole lot of space inside of it. I mean I could always fit two or three gallon milk jugs in there. It also was really quiet so you could never hear it like some of the older less efficient refrigerators out there. But to improve the refrigerator I would add water filters and a water dispenser. I would also add more freezer space because people freeze a lot of things like meats. Also, I would give it Bluetooth capability with a tv screen next to the water dispenser. Otherwise LG has indeed met my expectations. When they show off they really know how to make appliances look good. I think what they do and what they are good at is keeping things simple. Sometimes, these other brands have too much going on that it just doesn't do it for most people.",5

The ice maker was added luxury for me. There was nothing I disliked about the LG. It performed very well for me. Would definitely purchase another LG.

Or perhaps make the walls of the freezer thinner so that there's more room in them (although I know that'd be difficult to do).",3

I wanted a smart fridge, but you have to make a ton of money in order to afford one decent feature. I dislike the fact that certain features do not come as standard.

The LG refrigerator I used was spacious enough for us and I loved the fact that it was from a brand I trust and love. I loved the ice maker and water dispenser on it. The water from it was some of the best water. The fridge itself had tons of room and fit the space perfectly. The fridge we used had a bottom drawer freezer. I wasn't a huge fan seeing that it sometimes would catch if food shifted. The fridge had a lot of room...sometimes I felt too much room lol.

Henry,"Ottawa, ON","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2019","I purchased a new LG refrigerator in June 2015 and about 3 years later it stopped working. It turns out to be a faulty compressor. Even though the compressor is warrantied for 10 years I still had to pay over $300 for repair. I thought it may have been just a fluke but exactly one year later the same thing happened again. When I contacted LG they once again expect me to pay for repairs out of pocket. It is highly unreasonable that a refrigerator would not last past 3 years and then the ""repaired"" compressor would once again failed in just a year. Am I expected to have to pay $300 a year from now on to have an operating fridge? I've owned this fridge for well under 5 years and this should not be the case.

He thought replacing the compressor again along with the coils might help but wasn’t sure what was wrong with it. All he did was refill refrigerant.

The next available service was Sept 5. I live in a large city so it should not be this difficult to get service. The next day I spoke to the local LG servicer. After I explained that the sealed system has failed 3 other times they told me they could not service the refrigerator since they did not do the prior work. They went on to say that it was LG's policy to replace a refrigerator on the 4th sealed system issue.",1

I called Sears repair but they only had an appointment two weeks out on September 10th so I took it. That's a long time to go without a refrigerator. However, I read online that LG refrigerators have issues with their compressor so I decided to call LG direct to see if there was any warranty on my fridge I purchased in 2012. After the standard questions...the service agent provided me with a phone number of the local repair person for LG. I called Lilo and he was able to come out the very next day. He confirmed it was the compressor and then tested the motherboard to make sure the software would be compatible with the new compressor which it was, whew. I know there have been a lot of bad reviews here but I didn't have the same experience so I decided to take the time to post. Thank you for the help LG and I appreciate your service repair person here in Hawaii!",4
STUART,"Barrington, RI","Reviewed Aug. 30, 2019",After spending 2 hours on the phone with various Customer Service departments within LG -- and being referred to local support companies -- I finally learned that LG would not be able to cover a 7-year-old defective compressor without showing an original receipt. This is absurd and embarrassing that a company won't stand behind an appliance that's only 7 years old. There are multiple reports across the internet of LG having what's considered 'pandemic' issues with its refrigerator compressors failing...including a class action lawsuit. I will never buy another LG appliance again.,4

It took ~5 months of tech visits after it completely died but they never fixed it 100%. Despite the 10 year warranty, they just said ""sorry"" and offered me to either (1) deal with it or (2) take a check for half the price I paid for it 3 years earlier and void the remaining warranty.

Eileen,"Raleigh, NC","Reviewed Aug. 20, 2019","I liked my LG refrigerator when I bought it about three years ago, but its compressor went out, and I wasn't very happy with it a few weeks ago. I love the refrigerator, the way it operates as well as the shelving, and it's easy to take care of. But then I noticed my freezer things were getting a little mushy soft in the freezer. A few days later, my son came over and we went through the directions on how to restart it. You pull the plug and let it rest, which we did, and we adjusted some other things. But when I got up the next morning, my whole kitchen floor was full of water. So, he said the compressor went out on it. LG then came out here and put a new compressor in. They also sent me a check for the food that I lost, which I did lose a lot. I appreciate that I didn't have to put any money out, but it was very frustrating. A refrigerator should last longer than three years.",4

The GE refrigerator I gave away when my new LG arrived is still going strong and my LG isn't. I have insurance with a private company for all my appliances and air conditioner. I called them, they came and told me LG has nothing but problems. Bottom line they gave me some 4 oz of r143 with no guarantee it would last until the parts were ordered. The LG refrigerator needs entire sealed system compressor, start device for compressor, UV dryer condenser and evaporate coil, basically rebuilding it. I have been without a refrigerator for 2 weeks and won't have it for another week while waiting for the parts to come. I'm living with a refrigerator my son used when he was in college that holds just about nothing. No more LG for me.",2

Dan,"Richmond Hill, ON","Reviewed July 20, 2019","Our compressor and coil failed on our 4 1/2 year old fridge. We bought the fridge from Lowe's Canada with a 4 year extended warranty. About 2 years ago the fridge stopped working, all the food spoiled. We called the repair company and they fixed it. Just recently the fridge died. LG said they would send out a repair person in about a week! All the food spoiled. LG said the repair man would call us to schedule when he would be coming. The day before he was supposed to come, LG cancelled our appointment without telling us and said they need the repair man elsewhere and they would reschedule the appointment for TWO weeks later. Who does that to their customers? We called Lowe's and freaked out. They sent over another repairman who said the compressor and coil were pooched. ",1

My extended warranty not covered because I was told LG is now covering cooling issues for 5 years from purchase. After extended hold times with LG (over an hour each time) it took them over 2 weeks to send a repair person. Repair finally done on Wednesday, they changed out the compressor. Was told to allow fridge to cool for 24 hours before placing anything inside and 24 hours for ice. It has been 48 hours, shopped today for some food as everything had to be thrown out and the fridge and freezer are not cooling properly. Ice not freezing, few items in freezer mushy and milk and juice barely cool. Will have to get back on the phone with customer service tomorrow.",1
Angela,"Miami, FL","Reviewed July 18, 2019","Purchased fridge 1/1/2016. After 3 months we had to have it repaired because ice was forming on fan, they also had to evacuate the system and add freon. Took a few weeks for that repair. At 7 months old it stopped cooling (compressor went bad). Lost $250 worth of food. We had to use one of their authorized servicers due to the warranty and it took 2 weeks for a repair. Almost 3 years to the day after having replaced the compressor, it went bad again. The part is covered, labor is not. It will cost me $300+ for the repair and another $200+ for spoiled food. I should not be spending this kind of money to repair a $3000 refrigerator after only 3 years and 7 months. I have read numerous reviews and this is a very common issue. There have been several class action lawsuits and apparently LG is aware of the subpar performance of this appliance, yet still sells it.",1

Unfortunately after this exchange we have received no further communication from LG. They had stated they would stand behind the quality of their product however after more than 2 weeks of silence and a not functioning refrigerator I am losing confidence. I am disappointed that they set the expectation that they would help and then have failed to respond.

I am so frustrated right now and can promise you I will never, ever, ever again buy a LG product of any kind. This should not happen.",3
Adam,"Lee, NH","Reviewed July 1, 2019","When we purchased our house 3 1/2 years ago we purchased a new LG French Door refrigerator. We had checked the reviews and all were good. The fridge worked great for the first 3 years or so. About 4 months ago the ice maker stopped working. We did some troubleshooting of the issue but to no avail. It was no big deal at the time, we just started using ice trays. We should have known at the time that something was very wrong. So about 4 weeks ago the refrigerator died. We lost all of our food and had no back up at the time. The day it died I called LG customer service and they set me up with a company called A&E Factory Service. After a day A&E called me and said the soonest they could get a technician to my house was 2 weeks away!",1

Gave us 2 numbers for repair facilities, both would charge us to come and look at it. Then they have to send their finding to LG to get parts. Both companies told us that we would be responsible for trip charges plus anything LG doesn't cover. We are cutting our losses and getting rid of this piece of junk. LG should not be allowed to sell in the US until they come out with a quality product. No more LG appliances for us.",1
Paul,**,"Reviewed July 1, 2019",LG Inverter Linear Fridge Freezer GSL760PZUY. Purchased in France May 2017. We found the material not to be strong enough as the door was easily dented in the first couple of months. Worse though is that in 2018 we had to have somebody come and repair the ice maker. It was blocking up after a couple of months. It was fixed but in June 2019 it has blocked up again. We only have this appliance running half the year as half the year we are not in France. I see that others have had a similar problem. LG needs to take careful note of customers' complaints and fix this issue permanently or they will find that the buying public will not buy their appliances.,2
Yisroel,"Far Rockaway, NY","Reviewed June 30, 2019","Updated on 08/12/2019: I posted a review of LG refrigerator here a while ago. I described how shortly after the warranty ended, it needed a circuit board replaced and every shelf cracked. LG responded to me claiming this was unusual and they wanted to take care of it. They asked me for more and more information, model, serial number, date of purchase, photos, etc. This went on for several weeks. Finally they responded that the warranty was over and they owed me nothing. But they already knew this since my review already mentioned that. So the only reason they responded must be to give others the impression that they stood behind the products when they actually didn't. It was rubbing salt into a wound. I thought readers should know. And LG, don't bother responding. I won't fall for it again.",3

I requested a different tech but on 4th appointment he shows up at my door. And he only used 1 of the 3 parts that was ordered. I am super frustrated and the dumb tech even laugh that he could’ve fixed it the first time he came. This is 24 hrs later... the refrigerator is still not cold!!!! He didn’t even fix it.

I called Home Depot to complain and they informed me that LG will no longer allow anyone except LG service people to make service calls, so their hands are tied.

A few months ago the ice machine stopped working and I contacted LG support and they went thru all the 'steps' and unable to fix but I lived with it as it was only an inconvenience. Based on the research I have done, LG was quite aware that within months of the ice maker going the fridge compressor would fail. They never mentioned this once. After losing hundreds of dollars of food, I reached out to LG which advised to have a repairman come. For $125 he came and as soon as he saw the make and model he advised LG has a known issue which they refuse to correct and have a class action lawsuit against them. He offered to repair but the part is @ $800 and to top it off they would put the same faulty part back in which will also inevitably fail. ",1

The monumental problem is the horrible customer support and the way they try to keep delaying until you get frustrated and just lay out the money for another refrigerator. Planned obsolescence and they charge quite a bit. They should not be permitted to sell in the USA. I have been calling for our most recent refrigerator failure and they told me to wait by the telephone. They would call me on Monday and that was ten 10 days ago so I call and each time I call they state they are trying to find a service person and it shouldn't be that hard in a large city.

Repairman coming today, but looks like the compressor is bad, so likely buying a new fridge this afternoon. On top of that, the LG TV I bought about 2.5 years ago went out back in the winter and had to be replaced. The washer and dryer are still doing fine, but they are the exception.

The fridge is under warranty. From what I'm seeing on the warranty information, it's a 15-year warranty that technicians have been sent over and over again. The tech re-fixed the entire refrigerator with new parts, new compressor, and still, it's not working. I loaded it up the last time he did it, and I told the LG service people it's not working, and they told me, ""Well, bring the person one more time.""

It’s very unreasonable, although the issue has been resolved. My decision to buy an LG refrigerator was price-related. But when selling a product, companies should disclose fully the expectancy of the failure rate of their products versus advertising how wonderful they are. All manufacturers should disclose, “Okay.

We contacted customer service but they did not call us back so we found a service tech in our area who said the compressor is broken and it would be a major cost to repair. We are still not able to get any help from LG about this matter. Looking to see if other people have had the same problem.,1

The compressor was out and LG covered it but we had to pay $500 in labor. LG sent the wrong compressor not realizing till the wrong one was installed. Called them. They sent a second wrong compressor. Call them. Was told it was dc'd and is unfixable. I said my fridge is only 6 years old. They said I had to have my bill of sale. I can not find it. They told me they would figure out some other way to help and would call me in 3-5 business days. They did not call me so I called them. It was like starting all over again telling me to call the same people to come and look at it to service. After explaining several times he was short with me and rude and told me they will not help me without the receipt. What do they think? I walked out of Lowe's carrying a refrigerator and stole it.

What a total pile of crap. I would expect when paying $2200 for a new LG fridge that it would at least last 10 years or more without a major breakdown. So going by the rule of thumb on when to replace or repair a refrigerator since the repair cost is going to be more than half the cost of a new refrigerator I will be replacing this LG piece of crap with a new refrigerator of some other brand.

The loss of food compensation based on the size of my refrigerator (24.5 cu ft) was $150. Ridiculous. One health supplement alone was $40, not to mention the custom (and very expensive) food I was storing for my dog who is slowly dying from kidney disease.

Travis,"Corpus Christi, TX","Reviewed Jan. 16, 2019",LG is by far the worst refrigerator you can buy. It failed in 4 years due to a badly designed linear compressor. LG didn't ship the correct parts. They outsource it all to A and E appliance who is also an incompetent company who's scheduling is so bad its been two weeks and I still don't have a working refrigerator. They don't care at all. I can't even express the hoops I have jumped through and hours of talking on the phone that I have had to endure. I was holding on out of principle but the refrigerator is now heading to the landfill. I can't waste my time anymore. Not only will I be actively discouraging anyone to purchase a LG refrigerator but also doing any form of business with the company.,1

And on top of that the parts are a week out and I cannot set up the service appointment to replace the bad compressor until I have the parts in hand. And I was told LG is very bad at getting the parts out. So once parts are in hand I need to set up the appointment and oh by the way they are 2 weeks out because there is only guy that can fix this LG compressor. So that make 3 weeks without a fridge.

It smelled similar to the smell that it had when it was new that the manual said would disappear a few days after running it and it did go away. I called LG, and they sent a repairman, who opened the door, said he could smell nothing and that was it. Over 2 months, I called LG and I got the run-around until finally they said they will do nothing.

A couple of days ago, the right top hinge came loose, causing the door to hit me in the chest. I had to support the door to prevent it falling completely off. We were able to reattach the hinge pin and duct tape it to prevent a recurrence. This could have had catastrophic results. Prior to the hinge pin coming out, the door had been difficult to close properly, but we could not see what was causing the problem. I will not purchase any more LG products.",1

I called to have the unit looked at and they sent out a tech that agreed the ice was tasting like metal. He suggested replacing the water filter and I did. It solved nothing. I cleaned out the ice bin... solved nothing. Added baking soda as suggested by tech support... it solved nothing. Made sure food in the freezer was sealed in zip locks as suggested... it solved nothing. Water coming from the dispenser tastes fine, so obviously, somewhere in the Ice Maker unit, it's getting tainted.",1

If I could give it negative stars... they'd be in the triple negative digits. I purchased this unit in 2015 with a one-year extended warranty. Thank goodness for the extended warranty because it needed service a few months prior to the extended warranty expiration. There was ice buildup behind the icemaker as well as behind the entire back panel - between the back panel and the cooling coils. I've always left enough clearance between the vents and the food so as not to block any airflow. When I asked about the ice buildup, the repairman said this was an LG thing. WOW!!! AN LG THING...

Erik,"Thornton, CO","Reviewed April 17, 2018","Bought this $2600 fridge (LG LMXS30776S) in 2015. A week ago, noticed frozen fruit was soft enough to crunch. Took temperature of fridge and freezer compartments. Fridge: 49 deg F, Freezer 33 deg F. Compressor running non-stop. Pulled covers on evaps, partial frosting. No error codes. Got a replacement fridge off Craigslist that weekend. Plugged LG fridge back in, compressor comes on, but there is no cooling now. Indicates leak in sealed system. No error codes anywhere. Called local appliance shop -- $700 and it could take a month. Complained to LG on Facebook, they responded that they have a tech that could fix it total/flat rate of $375. Unbelievable. Pretty sure what happens with the compressor failure is that the refrigerant leaks out and the compressor keeps running harder and longer until it burns out. Can't believe that there aren't any sensors to at least shut it off before burning out. Won't ever buy anything LG again.",1

Wyn,"Worcester, MA","Reviewed Feb. 7, 2018",I bought this LG (Low Grade) refrigerator (lsxs263662) brand new when I bought my first house. This was the worst mistake I have ever made. I should’ve did more research on this company before I spent $2000 on a oversize cooler. I bought the fridge in 1/23/2017 and about a month of use it stop cooling. The whole fridge was full of groceries that all went to waste. I contacted LG and they sent a service tech to come look at it. He said it was a compressor issue and had to order a new one. About 2 weeks later the compressor arrived and he came back to repair it. About a month after that the refrigerator stopped cooling again. Again we contacted LG and same issue again. This time the service technician blamed it on the first service technician for the refrigerator failing again. So same deal he ordered another compressor and came back to repair it. ,1

Barbara,"Rincon, GA","Reviewed Jan. 2, 2018",This is the WORST appliance I have ever owned! Second day after receiving it we had to call repair out due to ice forming in freezer. So much ice in freezer we couldn't pull out the drawers. LG said it was a design flaw and fixed it. Fast forward. Luckily we had taken the extended warranty out for 5 years. In the 5 years we owned it before the warranty was up we had to have it repaired a total of 5 times with the last repair being the refrigerator totally stopped cooling. LG replaced the circuit board and said that should fix it. It didn't. They came back out and replaced the compressor. This fixed it but not totally. We were without a refrigerator for 1 full month. We had to turn the temperature lower than what it was actually cooling. I should have called them out again at that point but it was cooling. ,1

After calling LG, they said, through smart technology of my refrigerator, that the error code SBS-ERDS (defrosting system) will require a repair. They offered me a charge of $425 (1 year) or $338 (1 time) repair. I can't believe this! After only 17 months of usage, this piece of garbage refrigerator is already costing me more money.

Third time - Looked online at blown out version of parts while on phone with Customer Service. They sent the wrong part again, but same part as first attempt. Each time the Model number was verified having taken a picture of sticker on inside of fridge. Clearly the part # is mislabeled.

David,"Block Island, RI","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2017",I purchased my LG Refrigerator French Door LFXC24726S on 9/5/15 from Best Buy.

In July of 2017 or after about 6 months of actual usage Error FF (indicating a fan problem) appeared and the refrigerator ceased to cool. A local repairman (not LG) replaced two fans with no improvement. Since an LG repairman was unavailable on a timely basis I was forced to buy a replacement refrigerator since this is a seasonal rental home. I was able to get an authorized LG repairman in late August who with consultation with LG Tech Support diagnosed a probable Main Control Board issue since the board has been updated to correct a known internal fan icing issue. No repairs have been under warranty so after $300 for fan replacement and $500 for board replacement the refrigerator still produced Error FF and does not function.,1

The fridge is 60m degrees, crispers at 20, ""chilling drawer"" at 20-30, depending on its mood that day and the freezer is holding at 0. One repairman came, talked to tech services and was told then there was a service bulletin on this model. He followed the tech's advice and order a new board and a seal.

Teresa,"Pickering, ON","Reviewed July 14, 2017","We purchased an LG bottom freezer refrigerator on Nov. 17, 2014, model # LFD22786. In June 2017 we noticed the foods in the freezer had become soft and the fridge unit itself was not as cold as before. We called LG and they sent an LG repairman the next day. He deemed the unit unrepairable due to Freon leakage. Because we had already lost about $50 in perishables and some frozen foods we could not wait for the claim to be processed (approx. 5 business days) and decided to purchase a new one (another LG in fact!) while waiting for LG to determine a prorated refund for the now busted fridge.

We called, paid their set fee for repairs and set the appointment, a week out. They came, diagnosed compressor issue. They had to order it. It finally came. We called again. Another couple of weeks before they came to install. They said to give it a few days to work. It's still not working and they can't come until Monday -- over two weeks after the new compressor was installed. And now the refrigerator portion is not cooling. Each time we call, they merely say ""I'm sorry."" We have been homeowners for over 25 years and have never had appliance issues. DO NOT BUY AN LG!!! I wish I had known.

First call went to the other part of the world and they did some diagnostic. Then told to wait 24 hours so everything would be ok. After 24 hours, to have to throw all the food. Called again, set appointment and got the confirmation email. There was nobody show up. Called again, they said it scheduled for two days later. When I ask why I got email reminder they said maybe the computer glitch that did by itself. It like a jokes. The world still quite not advanced in artificial intelligence yet.

Joe,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA","Reviewed May 15, 2017","Three door LG fridge. 3 1/2 years old and broke down 6 times. Frequent canceled repair calls and many no call no shows. Have to pay labor, LG only covers parts that must be ordered, 7 days out. Who still takes that long to order anything. Then another repair call to install the parts, and another charge. Once again, you are lucky if it lasts more than a day or two. 6 months is good. LG could care less and Sears doesn't seem to care either. Perhaps a class action suit is in order. At the bare minimum it may force LG and their poor products and even worse customer service out of the market. As for Sears, they will likely be gone by this time next year.

They knew their compressors were junk, so they replaced the rotary compressor with a linear compressor a year after I bought this thing. Now, I have to decide whether or not to dump $1000+ into this one or get a new one. If I get a new one, I will be throwing away a beautiful looking, fancy, worthless $2500 frig.

What this means is I cannot buy food at the grocery store, like meat, in its original packaging, and just put it in the freezer. In a week, the freezer burns is starting to show up.

Maurice,"Sanford, FL","Reviewed Jan. 11, 2016","We purchased a brand new LG Refrigerator ""LFX33975"" fall of 2013 prior to moving into our new home. In less than a year 1/2, we noticed the bottom of the left side door beginning to rust on the bottom side. Directly below the ICE/WATER dispenser due to a manufacturer's leaking problem. We called LG's warranty department and they sent an LG specialist to come out and take a look at our complaint. He determined that there was a leak caused by the ice and water dispenser. The leak was due to a manufacturer's default. Because the dispenser should have never leaked out into the bottom of the door frame which caused the rust. The LG specialist said he would have to order a new door and a new ice maker that were shipped directly to our home. He then called to find out if both parts had been delivered and we told him yes.

However the genius, who designed this unit did not look at the height of cabinets in American kitchens. The CABINET fits our space, but the CORD comes out of the TOP of the unit, instead of the rear, adding another 1/4 inch to the dimension. An access panel also adds a small measurement to the height.

Unfortunately within months (it is less than a year old) I began to get rust lines on the front of my new french door refrigerator (LG LFC247700ST). It is on 4 of the corner areas of the door where there was no protective film placed on it for shipping. LG web support had no answer except that I could use a stainless steel cleaner on it, which I had been using. Since the front of the fridge does not hold a magnet, I assume it is not real stainless ""steel"" so why would there be rust? Very disappointed.",3

After several inquiries I was made aware that I could purchase the part from their certified parts distributor. I purchased the part and my repairman was able to install it.

I don't use the ice maker so I know that’s not the problem. If someone doesn't entirely close the freezer door, frost forms quickly. Once closed, defrosting builds up ice in the bottom and the door becomes almost impossible to close properly and water drips onto the floor in front. The solution is fairly easy. Take out the freezer basket from the main drawer and unplug the fridge. Within about 15 minutes you can pry up at the corner of the ice chunk and lift it out in one big chunk. Put the stuff back together and make sure the door seals properly. Turn it back on and put a note on the door to make sure people close it properly after use.",2

Will never ever buy LG again. They do not stand behind their products and they only give you the run around. An appliance should not have to be repaired this many time. I believe all three items are cheaply made and will continue to give me problems even after the warranty runs out.",4

Sheri,"Headingley, MB","Reviewed July 14, 2015",We bought 5 LG appliances in April of 2010 and had them installed in August same year. So far we have had to have the wall oven repaired twice after only 3 years. After the first repair it broke down again within 7 months and we were told the warranty for the new part was only 6 months! Trying to get a second repair took over a month of angry phone calls just to try to get a LG certified repair shop to even book an appointment! When contacting customer service they will not let you speak with any sort of management/supervisory personnel and there is no way to receive an address for a letter of complaint. Our convection microwave also stopped working after less than 3 years and had to be replaced at the same time as the second oven repair.

Again I had it serviced only to have it happen again and then it would not keep my overall refrigerator cold enough. I have lost food and then been without a refrigerator in between repairs. Now they are going to replace it but I am now without a refrigerator while paper works needs to be submitted and processed.

Had a $2,500 LG fridge, and 2 months after their ""warranty"" expired, the fridge and freezer both suddenly stopped working. Called the company and scheduled an authorized repairman to come take a look for $79. He was unable to locate the problem and basically said it was not repairable and that we were out of luck. He offered to try a few things that could possibly fix the problem, but each of those ""tries"" would cost a significant amount of money and there was no guarantee. In his words, each of these repair attempts would be like ""throwing a dart at a dartboard and hoping for a bullseye."" Obviously we declined this dartboard method of repair, and now we have to buy a whole new refrigerator. Suffice to say it will not be an LG!! What a piece of absolute garbage.

B.,"Chilliwack, BC","Reviewed Feb. 15, 2014","June 2011, we decided to replace our kitchen appliances. Not because our 27 year old Kitchen Aids did not work, but that they looked very outdated. After very much research, we decided on the LG 4 door LMX 28994 refrigerator with the Converta drawer, the LDF 7932 Dishwasher, and the LMS 2073 Microwave Oven. We choose to purchase a GE Monogram dual fuel range rather than an LG at that same time. Our decisions were carefully researched, and the choices made not only based on those particular appliances' features, but also upon the then available reviews. 10 months later, we woke to find the food in our fridge warm and spoiled, and our dishwasher no longer working. April 2012, LG replaced our refrigerator, and when I asked if a new warranty would take effect, was advised by LG that they would only extend our existing fridge warranty by 3 months. I asked why? It was a brand new refrigerator... should it not have a one year warranty? ",1

A technician was sent. He said he couldn't fix it, left and we heard nothing from him or the company. We called the warranty company again and they apologized, sent another company's technician, said he found what was wrong but had to order parts. This means we had up to a week to receive the part. In the meantime, we had to throw away all the food in the fridge and freezer. We were partially reimbursed for food loss (around $300.00 for food).

We set it at 45-47, it does 30-32. We’re throwing away lots of vegetables ruined by freezing. Even worse, when we needed repair for the compressor, under warranty, we contacted LG. Their repairman came out and said he would order the part, and then we never heard from him again. Only one local vendor would work on it.

When the repairman didn't show, we called the service. We were told, at first, that someone would be there, and then we were told that we were never put on the schedule. A service man ended up stopping by and told us that the problem is also the main board. It is a common problem that he works on all the time. He continued to tell us that LG was a very poor product, and we shouldn't have purchased it because of all the problems he addresses with them.

I called LG, and they offered me a flat rate deal to send a technician and fix the fridge (about $210). I paid and a technician came. The problem was the compressor relay. He could not order the part because it was discontinued. It took LG 4 weeks to agree that the part was not available (during that time, I was without a fridge). Every time I called to inquire, they told me to be patient. Now, their only offer is to pro-rate the fridge value and pay me around $900 towards the value of a new LG Fridge. I asked for a replacement; they refused. To add insult to injury, they said I am not even getting back the full $210 repair cost because the technician still has to get paid, although nothing was fixed. LG makes a wide range of goods. I will not be buying any of their products, ever.",1

We spent the extra money because we ""thought"" that LG was one of the best at the time.  This model has only the water-in-the-door; icemaker in bottom drawer.  The salesperson showed us why THIS bottom drawer was ""better"" than others with the same idea: the gear-type rollers were more substantial and the slides were larger.  The rationale was that it would be more durable.  In the past year, the freezer drawer is becoming harder and harder to pull out and/or push in.  I have taken the bin out and found grease/graphite  on the bottom of the unit and along the left rail.  Water from the icemaker also tends to build up as it sometimes drips onto the left rail, making the rolling very difficult.  After wiping it out, it seems to be fine for a few hours...then it's hard again.  We have had it with LG appliances.  We had an LG dishwasher that nobody would work on.

My concern is not so much the cost of having to replace the shelves. It is a question of the quality of the product. Should I expect to have to replace these shelves every 1.5 to 2 years? Are the shelves only built to last that long so LG can continue to make money, the way printers and ink cartridges do?",N/A

The same problem has occurred repeatedly since 6 months of purchase, three repairs to date. It keeps happening. Freezer ices up. This is not just my problem. I have found hundreds of complaints exactly like mine. LG will not support its product, claiming one year warranty. I think it's time for a class action suit.",N/A
Koula,"Westfield, IN","Reviewed Jan. 14, 2010","My LG refrigerator is a nightmare!  Upon delivery, the ice maker wasn't working.  They had to exchange it two more times for the ice maker.  Then, I started having problems within a couple of months with the ice maker and the temperature.  The service repair has been out three times and LG said after the third time that they could replace it.  However, no one is trying to help me or do that for me.  So many people have had the same problem, yet they are not fixing or replacing them.  How awful!  They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  I will never buy an LG again!  The worst refrigerator I have ever had!",N/A

Thomas,"Gardnerville, nv","Reviewed Jan. 10, 2010","In June of 2006, we bought an LG french style refrigerator from Home Depot. Fortunately, we took out Home Depot warranty on the refrigerator. All I can say is do not purchase an LG refrigerator. In the first year, we had the FF fan light come on. It was repaired under the LG warranty. Then the rail in the freezer broke, repaired under the Home Depot warranty. Ever since, I have had problems with moisture build up which causes the fan in the freezer to hit the ice build up. Home Depot has had their warranty company out numerous times, replacing the fan, removing the ice build up which is unbelievable. He comes out, he doesn't know what to do to stop this problem, he is coming out again this week. All I can say is I am so thankful for the Home Depot warranty we have. I bet out services are in the thousands of dollars, I am surprised stores are giving warranties on LG refrigerator. They are terrible! Buyer beware!",N/A
John,"Freehold, NJ","Reviewed Jan. 7, 2010","We bought the LMX25981SB French Door refrigerator from Best Buy at the end of August '09. The unit worked fine until it broke down completely the second week of December. I called LG and reported that neither the refrigerator nor the freezer was working. They sent a service man that was not experienced and had to call LG back and forth to figure out what was wrong. They determined that the compressor had to be replaced. The local service didn't have it, so LG had to ship it a week later! ",N/A
Paul,"Bonita springs, fl","Reviewed Jan. 7, 2010","We bought an LG refrigerator on eBay, and they shipped it to us.  We took all the plastic wrap off of it, and all the boxes off it.  It had two dents on it, and then we had a technician come to the house, and determined we had a bent bracket on the fridge side, and that you all might cover it, then he called and said you don't.  What I want to know is why you sell an expensive appliance, and then get stuck with a beeping door, because it wont shut.  What are you all going to do about it? I will not do business with you again. I hope to hear from your department in the near future. The consequences include a hurt back and ego.",N/A
